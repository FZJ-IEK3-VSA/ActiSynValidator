Welcome to ETHOS.ActivityAssure's documentation!
================================================
ETHOS.ActivityAssure is a validation framework for activity profiles and behavior models that generate them.
The framework provides modules for preprocessing and categorizing activity profiles, and for comparing them to the statistics of the validation data set.
For the latter, a Dash web application is provided that shows interactive comparison plots and indicators to individually assess each category.
